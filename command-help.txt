to set the project: npm install

to start the node js application: node server.js

Login logic between node js and react js
1. node js and react js are seperate servers running on different port
2. So Session concept will not work
3. Token System -> 
    - React will send the username and password
    - Node Js will verify whether the username and password is correct
        - Wrong
            -> It will reply Invalid login 
        - Success [JWT - Java Web Token]
            -> It will create a token [secret encrypted code - User information, expiry ]
            -> That token will be replied or sent to the react
            -> React will store it in localstorage
            -> After that -> for every action React will send this token also to the node server
                -> Node will check whether the token is valid
                -> If valid it will do the action
                -> If not valid it will reply "Access Denied"
